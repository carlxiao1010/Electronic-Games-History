        <h1>Computer Games (PC Games)</h1>
        <p>PC games, also known as computer games or personal computer games, are video games played on a personal computer rather than a dedicated video game console or arcade machine. Their defining characteristics include a more diverse and user determined gaming hardware and software, and a generally greater capacity in input, processing, and video output.</p>
        <p>Home computer games became popular following the video game crash of 1983 leading to the era of the "bedroom coder". In the 1990s, PC games lost mass-market traction to console games before enjoying a resurgence in the mid-2000s through digital distribution.</p>
        <h2>The first PC game is designed in 1962, called 'Space War'. This game worked on the PC called PDP-1. After that, in 1980s to 1990s when computer became popular, there were more PC games</h2>
        <p>The most boring PC game is called 'SQIJ', it's worked on Sinclair ZX Spectrum, in 1986 by Jason Creighton</p>
